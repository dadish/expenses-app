Expenses
========
This is an Expenses app.

## Structure
The app is divided to two root directories which are
essentially independent from each other. The purpose is to
separate the back-end logic from front end. This also allows
us to serve the static front end files from any static CDN
like github-pages. While the back-end API could be served
from your own servers.

Consult with the Readme files for [front-end](https://github.com/dadish/expenses-app/tree/master/front) and [back-end](https://github.com/dadish/expenses-app/tree/master/back) in their respective folders.
