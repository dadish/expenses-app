## User Story
✔ The user must be able to create an account and log in.
✔ When logged in, a user can see, edit and delete expenses he entered.
✔ Implement at least three roles with different permission levels: a regular user would only be able to CRUD on their owned records, a user manager would be able to CRUD users, and an admin would be able to CRUD all records and users.
✔ When an expense record is entered, each one has: date, time, description, amount, comment.
✔ User can filter expenses.
❌ User can print expenses per week with the total amount and average day spending.
✔ Minimal UI/UX design is needed.
✔ I need every client operation done using JavaScript, reloading the page is not an option.
✔ REST API. Make it possible to perform all user actions via the API, including authentication (If a mobile application and you don’t know how to create your own backend you can use Firebase.com or similar services to create the API).
✔ You need to be able to pass credentials to both the webpage and the API.
✔ In any case you should be able to explain how a REST API works and demonstrate that by creating functional tests that use the REST Layer directly. Please be prepared to use REST clients like Postman, cURL, etc. for this purpose.
❌ Bonus: unit and e2e tests!
✔ You will not be marked on graphic design, however, do try to keep it as tidy as possible.
